%Subject: numerical routine to solve hyperbolic scalar equation with 
%high-order resolution 
%Type of file: FUNCTION

%Goals:
%Calculate the Saturation Field by Using either First Order or Higher Order 
%Approximation of numerical function. To do it, a MultiDimensional Scheme 
%is achieved such as in Kozdon et al. (2011).
